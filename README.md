PathOfHero
PathOfHero is a browser-based RPG game developed by me, Jan Åšwiderski as a 2-week end project for the Coderslab course.
Although the game is not highly developed and visually average, it has potential for further improvement. I used my knowledge about Python, Html, Css and an image generator to create the game.
The mechanics of character creation and combat are based on the rules of D&D 3.5, i.e. dice rolls that are equally fair to the computer and the player.
