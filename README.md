<h1>Path Of Hero</h1> 
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Browser-based RPG game developed by me, Jan Åšwiderski as a 2-week end project for the Coderslab course.</p>
<ul>Based on:</ul>
<li>Django</li>
<li>Html</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<br>
<p>Although the game is not highly developed and visually average, it has potential for further improvement. I used my knowledge about Python, Html, Css and an image generator to create the game.</p>
<p>The mechanics of character creation and combat are based on the rules of D&D 3.5, i.e. dice rolls that are equally fair to the computer and the player.</p>
